## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Players take on the role of the Handler Hero, running through a map inspired by a Filipino street‑food market while dodging obstacles and collecting power‑ups. Every round feels fresh and unpredictable thanks to procedural generation.

The objective is simple: **survive as long as possible and compete for the highest score**.

Along the way, players must avoid harmful microbes and kitchen hazards. If the player collides with a microbe, the game pauses and presents a food health and safety quiz question. Answering correctly reinforces learning and allows the player to continue, turning mistakes into teachable moments.
